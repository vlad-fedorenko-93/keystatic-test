## 1. Organize Your Design System with Components and Styles

- **Use Figma Libraries**: Store components and styles (colors, typography, grids) in a shared library, ensuring all designers work with the same resources.
- **Naming Conventions**: Create a clear and consistent naming system for components, variants, and styles (e.g., `Button/Primary/Default`, `Color/Primary/Base`).
- **Hierarchy & Structure**: Structure components into logical groups (e.g., buttons, forms, typography). This ensures everything is easy to find and update.

## 2. Version Naming and Documentation

- **Version Naming**: Establish a clear versioning system (e.g., `v1.0`, `v1.1`, `v2.0`) for releases of the design system. Each version should reflect the scope of changes (major, minor, patch updates).
- **Release Notes**: When publishing new versions, document the changes, including added, updated, or deprecated components. This can be done via a changelog file or Figma documentation pages.
- **Version Snapshots**: Use Figma’s built-in “Version History” feature to periodically create and name version snapshots of the design file. For major updates, label the version clearly.

## 3. Component and Style Locking

- **Lock Stable Components**: Once a component is finalized, lock or mark it in the system to prevent accidental edits. In Figma, while there’s no “lock,” designers can work in a strict review system to avoid unapproved changes.
- **Branching for Updates**: While Figma doesn’t support Git-like branching, you can use duplication as a workaround. Duplicate the design system file for major changes and only merge changes back to the main library once they are reviewed and approved.

## 4. Establish a Governance Process

- **Approval Workflow**: Set up a formal review process for changes to the design system. Any new component, variant, or style should go through a design review with a lead designer or a dedicated team.
- **Collaborator Permissions**: Define access levels within Figma. Only a core team should be allowed to edit the design system, while others can use it as a viewer or with limited permissions.
- **Design System Team**: Assign a group of designers (or a single design system owner) responsible for maintaining, evolving, and documenting the system.

## 5. Communicate Changes with the Team

- **Team Updates**: When new versions are published, inform all relevant stakeholders (designers, developers, product teams). This can be done through team channels like Slack, documentation updates, or email.
- **Figma Annotations**: Add notes, guidelines, and usage instructions for components directly in Figma using comments or a separate documentation section. This helps in explaining how and when to use different components.

## 6. Maintain a Figma Project for Archived Versions

- **Archive Old Versions**: Create a separate Figma project for storing old versions of the design system. This allows access to deprecated components without cluttering the active system.
- **Deprecate Components**: Mark components as deprecated (e.g., using color or labels) before removing them completely from the system. This provides a transition period for users to update to the new components.

## 7. Sync with Development

- **Align with Code**: Ensure design system versions in Figma are synced with the codebase. If developers use version control (e.g., Git), sync the design updates with corresponding changes in the code to avoid inconsistencies.
- **Tokens and Automation**: Use tools like Figma Tokens or plugins to export design tokens (for colors, spacing, etc.) that developers can use directly in code. This reduces manual updates and keeps the design system in sync​⬤
